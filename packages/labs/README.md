# Lit Labs

An experimental playground for Lit helpers and tools. Your mileage may vary.

## Overview

The APIs, modules, and libraries available in labs represent features that
should be generally useful but are not yet ready for inclusion in the
core Lit library for various reasons. They are published via the labs package
primarily to gather user feedback.

These features may change significantly and frequently, or they may be
removed altogether. In some cases, when a feature stabilizes and proves to be
useful, it may move into one of the core Lit packages or a new package.

## Installation

From inside your project folder, run:

<!-- TODO(sorvell): This is likely not the correct package name. Update it when decided. -->

```bash
$ npm install @lit/labs
```
